HW 4
COP3402 Fall 22

NOTES:
As of now, this should work properly. When I tried using an input file with a newline at the end, it caused 
some errors, so please be sure the input file ends on the line with "end." and not on a new line.
I ran this on MobaXterm using the Eustis terminal and verified my results with the provided test input, 
so I hope this works for you as well.
Thank you for your work this semester, and have a nice break!
